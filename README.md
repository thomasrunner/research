## Overview

This repository contains original research papers authored by Thomas Lock. Each work explores foundational questions in physics‚Äîspanning quantum behavior, gravity, black holes, coherence, and emergent spacetime structure.

These papers are shared freely for the benefit of the scientific community, educators, students, and anyone curious about the hidden structure of the universe. More works will be added over time.

## Why It‚Äôs Free

This repository exists to contribute freely to humanity‚Äôs shared understanding of the universe.  
If these models stand, it will be because others find value in their structure and potential‚Äînot because access was limited.
